TODO

Make a list for clay of the patches that he -1'd but have an owner follow-up,
sorted by the community stars weights.

Make a script that takes an email address and gives you a list of stuff to
review and bugs to triage.

encouraging fast reviews is counter to getting high priority patches reviewed

imporatant reviews also have open bugs

are authors waiting on reviews also giving reviews?

are authors waiting on reviews already getting +1 reviews from non-core?

+1 comments with no comments are less valuable. check the `wc` of +1 comments

is there a patch that you reviewed waiting on your further feedback (author has responded)?

do you own a patch that has a negative review with no author follow-up?
